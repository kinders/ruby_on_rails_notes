h2. Multiple @can@ definitions

It is now possible to specify multiple @can@ and @cannot@ definitions with hashes and have it properly translate to a single SQL query.

```ruby
# in Ability
can :manage, User, :id => 1
can :manage, User, :manager_id => 1
cannot :manage, User, :self_managed => true
```

When using @accessible_by@ in the controller it will translate to SQL conditions that look like this.

```sql
not (self_managed = 't') AND ((manager_id = 1) OR (id = 1))
```

Also this change introduced little backward incompatibility issue. For example, if you had

```ruby
can :manage, User, :id => user.id
can :assign_roles, User do
  user.admin?
end
```

and then you called @can? :assign_roles, some_user@ it evaluated to @false@ when @current_user@ is not admin cause it stopped searching on @can :assign_roles, User@.

Now it evaluates to @true@ when @current_user == some_user@ because it falls back to @can :manage, User, :id => user.id@ .

Proper can definition should be now:

```ruby
can :manage, User, :id => user.id
cannot :assign_roles, User
can :assign_roles, User if user.admin?
```

And perhaps, good taste could be

```ruby
if user.admin?
  can :manage, User
else
  can :manage, User, :id => user.id
  cannot :assign_roles, User
end
```

which is also backward compatible.
