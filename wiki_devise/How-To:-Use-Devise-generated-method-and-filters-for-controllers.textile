# 使用devise生成控制器方法和过滤器

@$ rails generate devise User@

* authenticate_user!  - Signs user in or redirect
* user_signed_in?  - Checks whether there is an user signed in or not
* current_user - Current signed in user (e.g. current_user.email would give you the e-mail of the current signed in user)
* user_session - Session data available only to the user scope
* before_filter :authenticate_user!  # Tell devise to use :user map

@$ rails generate devise Admin@

* authenticate_admin! - Signs admin in or redirect
* admin_signed_in?  - Checks whether there is an admin signed in or not
* current_admin - Current signed in admin
* admin_session - Session data available only to the admin scope
* before_filter :authenticate_admin! # Tell devise to use :admin map

Also, you may want to use:

* -anybody_signed_in?- signed_in? - Check if the any scope is signed in session. 
The default argument for this helper is scope=nil, you can pass other scopes to check if admin, user, etc. is signed in.
