# 国际化
h2. Customize your own I18n solution.  定制自己的国际化解决方案

One easy way is to overwrite app/helpers/devise_helper.rb, which is mentioned as "A simple way to show error messages for the current devise resource.
一个简便的方法是改写appapp/helpers/devise_helper.rb，在注释中它被认为与“一个简便的方法来显示当前devise资源的错误信息，
If you need to customize this method, you can either overwrite it in your application helpers or copy the views to your application." in the comment.
如果需要定制这个方法，也可在程序辅助器改写它，或者将视图复制到程序。”

h2. Set default locale (config/application.rb)  设置默认本地

```config.i18n.default_locale = :sv```

h3. Use the devise-i18n gem  使用devise-i18n软件包

An effort to homogenize translations for devise is being made here: "https://github.com/tigrish/devise-i18n":https://github.com/tigrish/devise-i18n
有人已经为devise进行翻译了。


h3. Use a custom locale file 使用一个自定义本地文件

Alternatively use one of the following locale files.
也可以使用下面的本地文件：
Place them under config/locales.
将它们放在config/locales：
